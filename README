Installation
============

1. Use 'cabal build' to create the thing.

2. Run the command 'tourney-server sample' to initialize the database and
   create a sample assignment.

3. Visit 'http://testfest' with your Web browser. Login as 'arjun', with the
   password 'arjun'.




Configuration
=============

Create two new accounts, 'tourney' and 'student' on tesfest:

% useradd tourney
% useradd student

The user tourney needs the ability to sudo to student. Edit the sudoers file:

% visudo

and append the line

tourney ALL=(student) NOPASSWD: ALL





Ensure that port 5984 on testfest is firewalled.  Port 5984 gives full
read/write access to the CouchDB database.






Maintenance
===========

TestFest uses CouchDB as its database.  CouchDB includes a Web-based
management console called Futon that's good enough for many queries and
administration tasks. To open Futon, first forward testfest:5984 to a
local port:

$ ssh -N -L 5984:127.0.0.1:5984 testfest # localhost may not work

Then, visit http://localhost:5984/_utils from a Web browser.
